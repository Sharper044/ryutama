Ferocious treasure goblins have thin little stick-like legs, further than that nobody really knows what they look like because of all the treasure they cover themselves with. Coins, rings, bracelets, hair clips, odd socks for some reason, lost teddy bears, if an object has any sort of valuewhether it's monetary, magical, or sentimentala ferocious treasure goblin will add it to the heap. Because of this they tend to just look like a random heap of treasure, all stacked up in a vague sort of pile, either having a rest or wandering around look for more shinies to nab. If anything approaches the ferocious treasure goblin will run away, looking for a crack. Ferocious treasure goblins need cracks to summon their swirly little escape portals. Nobody knows where the portals lead. This world is full of mysteries. Anyway, it's impossible to actually catch a ferocious treasure goblin. They're too fast and too slippery. But you might be able to get a few whacks in before it finds a crack and does a little dance to summon a portal and disappears through it, with a sound like, 'pwip'. If a traveller manages to land a hit on a treasure goblin, it'll dislodge a sparkling shower of coins and small items. Roll 2d20 and multiply that by the damage done to determine the value of the coins and other items dislodged. For example, if a traveller does 5 damage to a treasure goblin then rolls 16 on 2d20, 80g worth of coins and items get dislodged by the attack. On a critical success not only does the value of treasure get doubled, but something special also got dislodged. I wonder what it could be! Maybe something valuable? Maybe just a sock. If the travellers lost an item or are searching for something then maybe it ended up in this treasure goblin's heap. Anything's possible! For every round a treasure goblin is fleeing, roll DEX + SPI for the goblin (d10 + d8) and DEX + SPI for anyone chasing it. Any traveller who rolls higher than the goblin managed to get close enough to get a whack in! They may make a regular attack roll against the goblin. If the goblin managed to outpace everyone in a round, roll DEX + INT (d10 + d6) for it, TN as follows: Hill, Mountain, Cave, wasteland, or other place with lots of cracks: 6. Woods, Jungle, terrainNames.urbane with natural features that might include cracks: 8. Grasslands or anywhere else: 10. On a success, the treasure goblin has found a crack and begins summoning its portal! Travellers may roll a final DEX + SPI against a TN of topography to catch up and give that treasure goblin one final whack before it disappears through its portal, which vanishes as soon as the goblin slips through."

They have squeaky high pitched voices that most find irritating but some find adorable. It's not known whether they're capable of intelligent speech or just a form of mimicry. Attempts to engage pixies in conversation are generally unsuccessful. They'll talk back to you, but their responses are just as likely to be random non sequiturs or babbling nonsense than anything related to what you said to them. Pixies attack using bolts or balls or arrows formed of elemental magic. They prefer to do so at a distance, hurling a few projectiles before darting away. They're fond of attacking, running away, hiding, then attacking again, an irritating habit that has enraged many a traveller. When defeated, pixies poof into a pyroxene crystal charged with their element. These crystals can be used in the creation of many magical items, and as such can usually be sold for a good price."

They're notoriously reluctant to engage in combat, running at the slightest hint of violence. If attacked they'll drop FakeSparkle Candy, perhaps in an attempt to distract the aggressors. If pursued, the masked fox will drop further sparkling candy along multiple paths to confuse and irritate. If cornered they'll retaliate with illusionary magic and surprisingly vicious little claws, but only ever in an attempt to get away. FakeSparkle Candy looks very pretty and enticing, sparkling and glittering like a piece of valuable loot. Once you pick it up the sparkle disappears and you're left holding nothing but a sticky boiled sweet."

They stand about three or four feet high and are intelligent enough to use tools and weapons and speak, in their sweet little voices, trying to sound tough but just making themselves cuter than ever. Kobold weapons are generally very primitive and simple, rock blades and crude spears. Kobolds are also able to utilise the combat potential of produce, using knives carved from large carrots, or clubs made from melons on sticks. These weapons are effective in the hands of a kobold, but completely useless when used by anything else. Kobolds are cautious creatures, shy but curious and with an endearing bravery and spirit of adventure, usually found roaming the land in nomadic groups. They have no inclination to settle down and build villages or even shelters. Kobolds feel trapped and uncomfortable inside anything with walls or a roof. In terrible weather they've been known to temporarily hide in caves or even houses, but they'll leave as soon as possible. Kobolds have an unusual method of reproduction; candy rebirth. When killed they explode into 1d3 liquorice allsorts, which any remaining kobolds will fight to the death to reclaim. These allsorts will be carefully stored and protected, until such time as the kobold band finds a place of strong natural magic. There, they will create shrines of flowers and sticks and rocks, a protective circle of sorts, in which they will place the candy of their fallen companions. They will also give offerings of magic items and gatherables. Through some mysterious process the kobold candy will absorb both the natural magic of the area and that of any offered items, eventually reforming into a kobold. Is it the same kobold as before? What about when multiple candy drops, are they all clones, or sisters or brothers or whatever? So many questions, in this world. So many questions. In combat kobolds are tactical and cooperative, barking out to each other to coordinate. If there are three or more kobolds in a group then each kobold gains +1 accuracy and +1 initiative. Kobolds are not usually inclined to fight without a reason. If attacked they're usually just try to get away. However, sometimes a band of kobolds will be actively searching for magical items. In that case they'll work together to steal magic items or gatherables the party has, then make a run for it. Travellers who follow the kobolds might find their cute little candy shrines, and likely be very confused as to what's going on. Kobolds are elementally aligned with fire, and can conjure cute little floating flames or ignite flammable objects. If they have time to plan an ambush they'll often stack dry wood around their escape path, then light it on fire as they leap past, creating a wall of flames to slow or stop their pursuers. Gatherables and magic items used in a kobold rebirth ritual are drained and completely valueless. Kobolds usually travel in groups of between four and nine."

They live in oceans, rivers, lakes and swamps, hunt nasty fish and any other monster that comes too close to the water, generally enjoy singing and fashion and have amazingly robust hair. Their teeth are pointed and their mouths wide for biting, their eyes large and wideset and oddly luminous, but otherwise they're fairly people-looking from the waist up. They usually wear clothes, often made of colourful woven seaweed and decorated with shells and gems, or land clothes enchanted to look good even underwater. Their scales are beautifully shiny and colourful. Some mermaids have developed their natural magical abilities to the extent that they can create a sort of mobile wave to carry them on land. However, these waves are soon absorbed into the ground or lost due to careless splashing. Usually they'll only last a few minutes, half an hour at the most. Certainly not suitable for extended forays inland. Mermaids can breathe just fine in and out of the water, so that's not an issue, but getting stranded and having to flop your way back to the water is pretty embarrassing. Mermaids tend to regard travellers with guarded curiosity. There have been some misunderstandings in the past on both sides, mostly due to the existence of hostile, carnivorous, feral mermaids who have a nasty habit of bursting out of the water and eating people. In combat mermaids will strike with weapons, most prefer spears and tridents but some use slim knives or clawed gloves. Unarmed, a mermaid can still grab and bite, or even give you an almighty slap in the face with their muscular fish tail."

Goblins stand between three and four feet tall fully grown, and are intelligent enough to use tools and weapons (although they're not very good at making them), construct (terrible) buildings and villages, hunt and build traps, and so on. They're probably capable of learning language, but nobody's every bothered to teach them. Mostly they communicate via jabbering, gestures, and a lot of jumping up and down. Generally speaking, goblins are crude, greedy, impulsive and cowardly. Goblin society has little structure and almost no hierarchy; they're constantly bickering and jabbering over the top of one another. The lack of a proper language doesn't help. In battle it's every goblin for itself, mostly because they couldn't coordinate to save their lives. They'll generally avoid travellers unless they feel like they outnumber them several times over, at least three goblins to every traveller. Even in that case they'll probably just try to distract the travellers and steal whatever they can grab before running off again. Goblins love shiny things and treasure, although any goblin will ignore boring old gold coins in favour of a shiny bit of foil or gaudy jewellery, even if it's fake. The flashier and tackier the better. Goblins are surprisingly sturdy, with no apparent sense of pain or injury. Often in battle they'll lose limbs or even their heads and just keep going. Wounded goblins recover relatively quickly, growing back teeth overnight and limbs in a matter of days. When a goblin takes too much damage it explodes into 1d3 fresh vegetables, worth 10g each. These vegetables are usually, but not always, similar to those found in the region. Reproduction is via gardening. The goblin gardener slices off a fingertip or punches a tooth out of another goblin's mouth, or if one of them lost a hand or limb or whatever while fighting they'll plant that. After a few days of absorbing magic and nutrients a tiny goblin bud will sprout, and over the next week or so will grow into a cauliflower or lettucelike plant (sometimes green, often another colour, always lurid). Once this reaches maturity (in another week or so) a fresh goblin will pop out, around half the size of a fully grown goblin. Goblins grow rapidly and will eat basically anything, mostly magical plants and vegetables. They'll also happily eat the vegetables dropped by their exploded fallen comrades. When very hungry, goblins will often fall to fighting amongst themselves, the first to explode becoming dinner for the others. Goblins are sometimes found travelling the lands in small parties of between four and twelve. If too many of their party are killed they'll stop and camp until they can grow new goblins to replace their fallen fellows. Sometimes they'll just stay in the area and continue to reproduce, building more permanent structures and creating a new goblin village."

They'll start telling a joke but get so caught up in the hilarity of it all that they'll rarely finish, collapsing into fits of laughter halfway throughand when one jolly beetle starts laughing any other jolly beetles nearby will start laughing too. And when you've got a bunch of jolly beetles all laughing away, well, it's actually pretty hard not to get caught up in that. Anyone trying to resist laughing along with a jolly beetle must roll INT + SPI with a TN of 6, at a -1 for every beetle laughing beyond the first, to a maximum penalty of -4 for five or more jolly beetles all laughing and carrying on. Failure means the traveller is lost in a fit of hilarity and can't do anything until the laughter dies down, although even then they're going to have to make another check to avoid catching a jolly beetle's eye and starting the whole thing off again. Success means the traveller is containing their laughter, probably letting out a snort every so often or squeezing their mouth tightly shut. This distraction means every action is taken with a -1 penalty until the traveller is out of both sight and sound of the jolly beetles. Critical success means the traveller does not get the joke here. It's not funny to them and they do not understand why anyone is laughing. They may act normally around the beetles, with no penalties. In terms of combat, jolly beetles are completely useless. They wouldn't even know where to begin. Their only real defence is to get whatever's attacking them to collapse in a fit of laughter, then roll away before anyone catches on. Problem is, the jolly beetles are just as likely to get caught up in that laughter too, and completely forget they're supposed to be trying to escape. It's a funny sort of life, for a jolly beetle."

                description: "Odd little monsters that are basically a single large eye with arms and legs, standing around a foot or two tall. They sometimes have horns, or claws, or rarely wings. They're intelligent enough to use basic weapons, mostly spears, and to make adorable little hidden villages in out of the way places. It's very rare to encounter an eyelet on its own. Mostly they move around in groups of at least half a dozen. Extraordinarily perceptive individuals might spot a lone scout, but only for a second before it vanishes. In combat they will blow horns or otherwise signal for reinforcements, which will arrive quickly to back up their comrades. Eyelets have been observed to demonstrate intense loyalty. New eyelets are formed by magic grounding into fallen fruit, and eyelets are intelligent enough to take advantage of this phenomenon. They will often build their villages around or near places of natural magical power, gather fruit themselves, make dolls out of them using sticks and leaves and simple paints, then place them in areas where magic gathers. Soon enough, the magic will ground into the doll and become a new eyelet. Eyelets generally won't attack anything bigger than they are, but if threatened will defend themselves. Especially true if their village is in danger. They're tough for their size, bouncing back from attacks and capable of coordinated assaults, although their aim isn't great (no depth perception). Mostly they'll just be trying to drive off aggressors, and won't pursue fleeing opponents except to make sure they're not coming back. Eyelets turn into impossibly perfect fruit when destroyed, which has led to SOME people hunting them down and destroying entire villages in order to collect and sell the valuable produce."

Perfect for whacking away if you happen to have a tennis racket on hand, with a satisfying 'bwoing' sound and maybe a little sparkle effect after they vanish into the sky. In any case large bees are manifestations of irritation, and they do love to be irritating. They'll often be found in tiny swarms (2 - 4) near gatherables or places of natural power, slurping up ambient magic and grumbling to each other. Large bees love to grumble. If anyone approaches, and especially if they're after the gatherables, the large bees will attack. They'll chase you, too, until you're well away from their precious gatherables. Then they'll head back, grumbling all the while. The first time a PC gets stung, roll 1d6. On a 1 that PC is allergic to bee venom! They take an extra 1d6 damage whenever stung, swell up like crazy, and gain the status Poison[4]."

They are very good at keeping still and blending into the background until they move, at which point they are a flurry of violent motion. Attempts to spot a grey mantis take a -2 penalty, possibly more depending on the environment. Grey mantises are neither aggressive nor greedy. They appear to possess an odd sort of honour, and will generally not attack unless challenged. They have never been known to speak, but they seem to understand spoken language. Any sort of challenge will be met by the mantis bowing, then raising its twin scythe-arms and attacking. The exception to this is other insect-type monsters, such as sick flies and large bees and giant spiders, which mantises will attack on sight. Nobody has quite figured out why this is, but a canny traveller can certainly take advantage. Grey mantises are known to enjoy senbei."

What happens if a blibbler manages to grab you? I don't know, and I don't want to find out. Blibblers are a bit shy of other monsters, but if a traveller is distracted fighting something else a blibbler might take advantage of that to squeeze out of a crack and try to grab them.

Obvious mushrooms are usually pretty big, absorbing magical energy from the air and soil, as well as nutrients from anything that happens to die nearby. Every obvious aspect of an obvious mushroom can vary wildly; the noise it makes could be a shriek or a yell, or babbling chatter, or whistling, or singing, or mimicked animal cries. The colours can vary from black and white checks to purple and yellow polkadots to a staggering variety of plaid. The scent can be pleasant or obnoxious, cloying or bitter, sweet or sour, rotting or fragrant. Even the pulse of kinetic energy can vary from the passing of a strong breeze to a tickly feathery sort of sensation to a tingling buzz to a firm shove against the chest. The closer one gets to an obvious mushroom the more obvious it becomes; the noise gets louder, the smell grows stronger, the colours seem brighter, the pulse gets firmer. Standing right next to an obvious mushroom can be overwhelming. If a traveller is in the same area as an obvious mushroom, close enough to notice all of its obviousness, they suffer a -1 to all rolls because of the distraction. If they are close to the mushroom this penalty increases to -2. Obvious mushrooms have no means of attacking, on their own, but are often accompanied by other monsters. These monsters have grown used to the obvious mushroom's presence and take advantage of its obvious qualities, which might attract insects or animals or other monsters to the area, or else keep others away."

If a vampiric chestnut reaches 16 MP it is full, bloated with energy, and will clumsily fly off to hide and rest and plot its next exquisitely evil scheme.

They're not particularly mobile, but it's worryingly easy to run into a patch of them and end up in the middle of a flowery dance party before you know it. Dancing flowers are not aggressive, but they do like to dance, and when they dance it's very difficult not to dance along with them. Probably some sort of charm magic, nobody has had much luck researching them because instead of taking notes the researchers just ended up dancing. Tricky situation, really. Any traveller trying to resist dancing with the flowers is going to have to make an INT + SPI roll against a TN of 8 to resist the weird allure, with a -1 penalty for every three dancing flowers around (with a maximum penalty of -4 for twelve or more dancing tulips). (Travellers with the status effect Tired automatically resist the temptation to dance.) Success means the traveller has fully resisted the boogie temptation and can act sensibly, although they can still have a bit of a dance if they want to, without HP loss. Failure means they can do nothing but dance. Every round, they can attempt another check (as above) to break out of it and stop dancing. Anyone dancing with the flowers takes 1d4 HP damage per round. If a traveller's HP is reduced to 4 or less by dancing they collapse and gain the status effect Tired[6]. On the next round they can drag themselves away, or maybe just have a bit of a rest on the ground there. The dance party mood will generally continue until the traveller is well clear of the flowers, although they'll probably be tapping their feet for an hour or so afterwards."

After bursting out of their rock, rockbacks tend to stay in the same area, because moving around too much is tiring. They'll eat smaller rocks in the area and pretty much anything else. However, most of the time they'll just be sleeping, tucking themselves up and looking much like any other rock, until a bunch of travellers come stomping along and wake them up. Rockbacks attack by curling up then bursting forward in an attempt to slam into their enemies. They also pick up rocks and throw them, or just lumber around swiping their arms at anything nearby. As you'd expect, they're pretty tough. Once they're defeated they explode, leaving nothing but a bunch of gems behind."

They're a bit of a mystery, to be honest, although rumours that they only exist to fill in the X section of bestiaries are completely unfounded. Beneath their rocky spiky top bit they have dozens of squiggly little legs. Not very appealing to look at. Xenolithic sneaks can make only one attempt to attack. After that they've fallen over and will take 1d4 hours to get up again (or 1d4 x 360 rounds).

We love them and we hate them, oh yes we do. Mimics are what you get when a bunch of magic grounds into a mundane storage container, like a chest or a sack or a cupboard or a pouch. Ever see a pouch mimic? They seem cute but they can take your hand off if you're not careful. Mimics are driven to fill themselves up with stuff, which often includes treasure, sometimes belonging to those unfortunates who were not taught to be wary of random chests. (Mimics don't actually eat people, contrary to popular rumour. They just chew them up a bit, steal all their stuff, then spit them back out again.) Generally mimics just sit around waiting for someone to try to peek inside, but they're notoriously moody. When a mimic is disturbed roll 1d8 for its reaction: 1 - 5: Hostile! Snappy! Ever seen a chest that can take a bite out of you? The mimic will attempt to eat the traveller! Of course living matter isn't of any interest to it, but the travellers' items and gold is at great risk. If a traveller tried to open the mimic without checking it first, they must roll DEX + INT against a TN of 10 or be eaten! See below for details on this unfortunate state of affairs. Even if the traveller escapes being eaten, the mimic is grumpy and attacks! 6 - 7: Scared! Running! As soon as the chest spots the travellers it's off out of there! If the travellers want what's inside they're going to have to give chase. 8: Docile. Generous. The mimic is bloated with treasure and will graciously allow each traveller to take one item from inside. The Ryuujin can decide what's inside, or roll for random treasure, or each traveller can describe what they take. If any traveller tries to take more than one item that mimic is gonna snap shut and either become hostile or run for it. Whenever a mimic hits, roll 1d6. On a 1-3 do damage as normal, on a 4-6 the mimic has instead stolen an item or coins worth 1d4x50g. If a mimic scores a critical hit, it has eaten its target! They take normal damage and are now inside the mimic. Every subsequent round they can roll STR + DEX against a TN of 8 to break free, otherwise the mimic rolls damage against them and steals 1d4 items (containers and their contents count as one item) and 1d4x50g. Instead of trying to get free, the person inside can attack the mimic. No Accuracy Check is needed, just roll damage. The mimic cannot attack anyone else while it's chewing on someone inside itself, but it can move around and even flee from battle. If the person inside reaches 0  HP: then the mimic steals every item they're carrying and all of their gold and spits them out, naked except for their underwear. Mimics will also spit out people once they've stolen all their items and gold. When a mimic is defeated, it becomes a regular inanimate chest or sack or cupboard or whatever. Inside? Lovely lovely loot. Also any stolen gold and items, although they might have lost a point of durability. Any item of clothing eaten by a mimic will be freshly laundered and neatly folded. Nobody knows why. There are rumours that mimics can be tamed and used as travelling companions and storage containers. Such a thing would be immensely useful. What a remarkable and tempting rumour! If it were true then the tame mimic would be a Gross Sturdy Walking Container with a durability of 10, able to hold 15 size of items. To the right buyer it would be worth upwards of 8000 gold. materials are: 1d12x100g and probably some items and treasure, too. Also the thing it was mimicking."

During summer slimes tend to be blue or yellow and with a gemlike gleam, often wearing sunglasses or straw hats. In autumn you'll see slimes accessorising with large leaves, and favouring deep reds, browns and golds. In winter slimes are usually coloured icy blue or even white, and are sometimes seen with scarves wrapped around themselves or with woollen hats. In spring slimes burst into every colour imaginable, green and blue and red and yellow and everything in between, bright and clear, often decorating themselves with flowers. Unfortunately the quality of all cute slime accessories is appalling. Close inspection will reveal that they're actually just made of slime, hardened or softened or stretched into shape. They'll fall apart within hours of being removed from a slime, and have no value or use whatsoever."

Formed of dense wobbly magic formed around a cluster core of sinister thoughts and dastardly deeds, evil jellies spend their time wobbling around looking for cruel pranks to play on people. Evil jellies are tricky and mean, doing things like sticking on ceilings or waiting above doors so they can drop on people's heads, or blocking dark corridors so that anyone running down the corridor will blop straight in and get stuck inside, or squishing themselves into a kind of puddle on the floor so they can trip or catch people walking on them, or stretching themselves out between two things like trees or walls at about face height, so anyone carelessly walking between those two things will get a faceful of evil jelly, which is just the worst. After they've played their tricks they'll usually just try to run away, to set up another prank somewhere else, but if cornered they'll fight, leaping with alarming alacrity right at your kneecaps or lashing out with jelly tendrils. They're very resilient to attacks because of their dense jelly form. Maybe the most annoying thing about evil jelly is that you can hit it and hit it and hit it and it just simply refuses to die."

Sometimes they have a yellow or blue or green glow to them, other times they're just white. Yoghurt ghosts are often very shy, to the point that if you look straight at them they'll cover their face with their cute little ghosty fin things and blush until you look away. And then they'll come right for your neck! Well, not really. Yoghurt ghosts tend not to be aggressive, although they do enjoy a little snack of magic or life energy. Regarding travellers, yoghurt ghosts will often try to just sort of subtly float up behind them and take a quick bite of magic/life, before scurrying away again, or whatever the floaty equivalent of scurrying is. Seeming to prefer poorly lit spooky areas, yoghurt ghosts are almost never found alone. They'll often space themselves out around an area, performing slow dances in circular formations or lining up and glowing in a sequence of colours that seems to hold some hidden meaning or message or the key to unlocking a secret door, but which is really just a distraction while a couple of their friends sneak up behind you for a bite of magic. Yoghurt ghosts ignore armour, do damage to MP rather than HP, and add the damage inflicted to their own MP and HP. When damaged by a yoghurt ghost, roll INT + SPI with a TN of double the MP drained. Failure results in the status effect Muddled[4]. If already Muddled, increase it by 1."

But what happens to those dragons that are driven from their homelands? Those dragons become “Wild Dragons” or “Nora-Ryuu”, and wander the earth in search of a new home. However, most wild dragons are extremely resentful and angry at the loss of their homelands, and as such, people view these wild dragons as a very dangerous threat. Also, because the very land they controlled and called home was torn from their grasp, these once-beautiful and noble dragons have become corrupted and twisted.',
